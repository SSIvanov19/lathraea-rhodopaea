## Information and development of a plan
### Presentation of the project
Our game generates a maze that is different each time and you have to go to the exit while dogging enemies and helping the wizards.

### Roles in the team
Stoyan Ivanov - [SSIvanov19](https://github.com/SSIvanov19) - Scrum trainer  
Stas Uzunov - [SSUzunov19](https://github.com/SSUzunov19) - Back-end Developer  
Viktor Kirov - [VRKirov19](https://github.com/vrkirov19) - Front-end Developer

### Introduction
#### What is the product?
The product is a C++ console application about mazes and maze generation. It represents a simple game, where you need to escape from the maze while dogging enemies and helping the wizards.
#### Where is it available?
Our collaborative work took place in GitHub and for the files to be accessible to everyone they were uploaded in the GitHub Repository of our project. You can download the latest release from GitHub releases (Insert URL here) or the download section (Insert URL here).
#### Communication?
Communication is realized through Teams. Thanks to all the features and the provided visualization - on-screen communication and feedback are sufficiently complete.
#### What technologies are used?
The technologies we used are C++ as the programming language with which the code is written, Git and GitHub for collaborative work, Visual Studio 2019 - as an IDE, Teams - connection and communication and Doxygen - preparing a presentation and documentation.

### Method and manner of implementation
#### Productive work
The tasks are defined in a way that everyone is aware of the tasks performed so far to present and answer quickly, clearly, and accurately, and teamwork is more efficient and productive.
#### Distribution of tasks
For each task, a person is selected who is more familiar with the field and will be able to perform the task in the most competent way possible.
#### Terms
Observance of dates was reminded by the Scrum Trainer. A meeting of the team is held every week to discuss the amount of time needed to complete the assigned task.

## Testing the plan
### Develope a algorithm to generate a maze
This was the start of our project. The first thing that we should do is an algorithm to generate a maze.
### Develope a menu
The menu will help the user to see more info about our project, to change settings and see how to play the game.
### Visualization of the maze
Implement a function for visualizing the maze on the console.
### Implement a player
The player will be spawned into the maze and should move in any direction, while it should check for obstacles.
### Implement advanced back-end features
Implement features like health, enemies, armour, etc.
### Developing a UI
Make UI element for showing different different stats of the player.
### Implement visualization for the enemies.
Show enemies and shop in the console.
### Add final thing
Add details to the project.
### Fix bugs
Fix the reaming bugs. 
### QA Documentation
Checking the correctness of the code.
### Documentation
Periodically made documentation describes the whole work and each application of the website.
### Presentation
The aim of the presentation is to be short and tell everything important about the project.

## Back-end developer
The Back-end is the whole logic of our game, starting from the creation of a room and the monsters in it, to the maze we have to go through to continue the game. The rules of the game are designed to be balanced against whether the player is playing correctly or not
All the room and everything that can fall into it, as well as the maze are randomly checked, which is also checked for errors. 

## Front-end developer
The task of our front-end developer was to make the game look good and to make it more interactive. For this purpose, he used different ASCII characters that you can see just under this text.
### Here you can see what ASCII characters are used and what they represent

│ = upper part sword  
╪ = down part sword  
♀ = Key  
♥ = Health  
Θ = Armour  
■ = First monster  
♦ = Second monster  
╦ = First part third monster  
░ = Second part third monster  
╤ = First part fourth monster  
╫ = Second part fourth monster  
╬ = First part fourth boss  
▓ = Second part fourth boss  
╔ = Third part fourth boss  
╗ = Fourth part fourth boss  
¥ = bush  
≡ = rock  
╔ = hole up-left  
╗ = hole up-right  
═ = hole mid part (Horizontal)  
║ = hole mid part (Vertical)
